To implement a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms, we'll follow these steps:

Step 1: Load the Dataset
First, we need to load the dataset and inspect the first few rows to confirm the columns.

Step 2: Preprocess the Data
We'll select the relevant features and handle any missing values.

Step 3: Split the Data
We'll split the data into training and test sets.

Step 4: Train the Linear Regression Model
We'll train a linear regression model using scikit-learn.

Step 5: Evaluate the Model
We'll evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

Step 6: Make Predictions
Finally, we'll make predictions on the test set.

This workflow can be extended and refined by including more features, performing feature engineering, and trying different models to improve performance. The dataset also contains many other potentially useful features that could be incorporated to create a more robust predictive model.
